# Neural-Chatbot

Neural Dialog Model are Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models that produce
conversational response given the dialog history. In this project we will
build a simple single turn conversations to make based on the data
In this assignment you will implement,
• Seq2Seq encoder-decoder model base on LSTM model
• Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism
• Greedy search decoding algorithms
